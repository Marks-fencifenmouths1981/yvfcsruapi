just got out of The Electric State, man, and god, that theater was a zoo. Some kid kept kicking the back of my seat. anyway, the  ? what a trip. imagine if a spaghetti western had a baby with Blade Runner and they raised it on Saturday morning cartoons. Weird, right??

dark, dusty roads. that girl and her robot... felt like they were pulling me through their memories. what was her name? Michelle? 𝘮𝘦𝘨𝘢n? whatever. those massive, silent machines littering the landscape like worn-out giants sleeping off an eternal hangover. It made me think of my old computer, the one I tried to salvage with duct tape and curses. equally lifeless.

> popcorn specks everywhere, like I've survived a mini tornado of salty crumbs. ugh. is that a kernel stuck in my molar? gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to catch the dialogue I missed while juggling a mouthful of overpriced soda. who pays $6 for what amounts to sugary tap water anyway?

back to that glowing, buzzing neon - it was less of a background, more like a character itself. alive, but kinda sad, like an old disco ball remembering its prime days. and the music! it did something weird to my brain, like trying to scent out nostalgia while stuck on a rollercoaster. i kept thinking - when did someone ask me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? last week? time feels slippery after that viewing.

was there a scene with a dinosaur? or did that headache-inducing blasting commercial before the trailers twist everything into a fever dream of nonsense?

> surprise was my biggest companion, whispering in my ear while the ach in my back chanted along. as the credits rolled, realized i couldn't feel my right leg. guess it had fallen asleep somewhere between the desert wasteland and robot parade.

whoever asked if they should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   – reminder: don't forget earplugs. my head's still resonating, like a sonorous bell strung too soon. damn sound effects.

random thought, but why did the robot have such soulful eyes? sorta like a wise old retriever, minus the drool. got me feeling all existential, pondering the universe while trying not to trip over sticky gum on the floor.
